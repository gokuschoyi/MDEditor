Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a topic of discussion for decades, but recent developments in the field have brought it to the forefront of public consciousness. The potential of AI to transform the world around us is enormous, but it also raises concerns about the safety and ethical implications of creating super-intelligent machines. In this article, we will explore the latest developments in GPT-4 and OpenAI, and their potential impact on the future of AI.

## The Enormity of Godlike AI

The concept of Godlike AI, or super-intelligent machines that can learn and develop autonomously, has been a topic of discussion in the AI community for years. However, the exponential curve of progress towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and the much less impressive curve on the progress of alignment, which is aligning AI systems with human values, has raised concerns about the safety and ethical implications of creating such machines.

According to Ian Hogarth, an investor in Anthropic and a co-author of the State of AI Annual Report, "a three-letter acronym doesn't capture the enormity of what AGI would represent, so I will refer to it as what it is - godlike AI. This would be a super-intelligent computer that understands its environment without the need for supervision, and that can transform the world around it." However, he also notes that we are not there yet, and the nature of the technology makes it exceptionally difficult to predict exactly when we will get there.

Jarn Leiker, the alignment team lead at OpenAI, acknowledges that aligning smarter than human AI systems with human values is an open research problem, which basically means it's unsolved. Sam Altman, one of the top executives at OpenAI, also recognizes the gap between capabilities and alignment. When drafting his recent statement on the path to AGI, he sent it to Nate Suarez of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute. For one of the paragraphs, Nate wrote, "I think that if we do keep running ahead with the current capabilities to alignment ratio, or even a slightly better one, we die." After this, Sam Altman actually adjusted the statement, adding that "it's important that the ratio of safety progress to capability progress increases."

## The Controversy Surrounding OpenAI

The controversy surrounding OpenAI has been a topic of discussion in the AI community for some time. The pause experiment letter, which was signed by several researchers at OpenAI, became a controversy, with some people suggesting that the only reason certain people signed it was to slow OpenAI down so that they could catch up. This cynicism unfortunately has some new evidence that it can cite with Elon Musk forming his new AI company called Xai.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the company has recruited Igor Babushkin from DeepMind, but has not been that successful at recruiting people from OpenAI. One theory as to why is that when Musk left OpenAI in February of 2018, he explained that he thought he had a better chance of creating AGI through Tesla, where he had access to greater resources. When he announced his departure, a young researcher at OpenAI questioned whether Mr. Musk had thought through the safety implications. According to their reporting, he then got frustrated and insulted that intern. Since then, he's also paused OpenAI's access to Twitter's database for training its new models. So it could be that GPT-5 isn't quite as good at tweeting as GPT-4.

## GPT-4 Conducting Science

One of the most significant developments in the last few days linked to GPT-4 and OpenAI is the news that GPT-4 will be conducting science. According to Sam Altman, GPT-4 will be used to generate scientific hypotheses and design experiments to test them. This is a significant development because it could potentially accelerate the pace of scientific discovery.

However, there are also concerns about the safety and ethical implications of using GPT-4 to conduct science. As Ian Hogarth points out in his article, "the risks of using GPT-4 to conduct science are significant. If the machine generates a hypothesis that is incorrect or dangerous, it could have serious consequences. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential for bias in the data that GPT-4 uses to generate hypotheses."

Moreover, there are concerns about the safety implications of OpenAI's recent actions. According to a recent article by AI researcher Jack Clark, OpenAI has been connecting GPT-4 to a massive range of tools, including Slack and Zapier. Jarn Leica, the head of alignment at OpenAI, recently tweeted, "before we scramble to deeply integrate LLMs everywhere in the economy like GPT Four, can we pause and think whether it is wise to do so? This is quite immature technology and we don't understand how it works. If we're not careful, we're setting ourselves up for a lot of correlated failures."

## The Implications of Godlike AI

The developments in GPT-4 and OpenAI have significant implications for the future of AI. On the one hand, the potential of AI to transform the world around us is enormous. It could lead to breakthroughs in medicine, energy, and other fields that could improve the quality of life for millions of people. On the other hand, there are also concerns about the safety and ethical implications of creating super-intelligent machines.

As Ian Hogarth notes in his article, "the development of godlike AI is not inevitable. It is a choice that we make as a society. We can choose to prioritize safety and ethical considerations, or we can prioritize speed and progress at all costs. The choice we make will determine the future of AI and the world that we live in."
